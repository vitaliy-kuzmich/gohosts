light weight alternative of pihole script. It just merge different hosts files. You can take hosts links from here : https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts. If you have your own hosts file, just mention it at /etc/gohosts.json at hosts. It removes duplicates, and replaces 127.* with 0.*, skips empty lines, etc...  Will create default settings on first run.
